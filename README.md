# PiedPiper-name-in-progress-

This is basically designed to include:

	- a web portal for tutors such that tutors who teach 12-15 students per group have a convenient way 
	to communicate with their students, assign homeworks, & share documents/links.

	- A one stop resource for british educational system (A-Level) students. It will provide:
		- access to up to date past exam papers for all curriculums
		- access to notes either from collaborating tutors or from other resources.
		- access to recommended exam tips, syllabuses, grade boundaries, etc ...

	- An educational forum that will allow student to ask questions and have it answered by other students. 
	The forum will have the following categories:
		- Private forums for tutors and their private group so that they can communicate about group specific info/material
		- Public forums for everyone else (even if they are not registered to a collaborating tutor)
