**planning on having a working prototype by late December.

## MVP:

	- Managing payments, assignments and communications for multiple 12-15 student groups.

	- A one stop resource for british educational system (A-Level) students. 
		This includes:
		- access to up to date past exam papers for all curriculums
		- access to notes either from collaborating tutors or from other resources
		- access to recommended exam tips, syllabuses, grade boundaries, etc ...

	- An educational forum system categorized into:
		- Private forums: Only tutors and registered students can view and contribute
		- Public forums: for everyone else (even if they are not registered to a collaborating tutor)

## Extra feature:
	- Adding a bot that uses NLP to answer exam logistics, rules, dates, deadlines & syllabi questions
